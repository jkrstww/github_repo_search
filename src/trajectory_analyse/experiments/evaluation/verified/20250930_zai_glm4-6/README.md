# GLM-4.6

[Blog](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5) | [HF Model](https://huggingface.co/collections/zai-org/glm-45-687c621d34bda8c9e4bf503b) | [Try It](https://chat.z.ai/)

GLM-4.6 is built with 355 billion total parameters and 32 billion active parameters, designed to unify reasoning, coding, and agentic capabilities into a single model in order to satisfy more and more complicated requirements of fast rising agentic applications.

GLM-4.6 excels at coding, including both building coding projects from scratch and agentically solving coding tasks in existing projects. It can be seamlessly combined with existing coding toolkits such as Claude Code, Roo Code, and CodeGeex. To evaluate the coding capability, we compared different models on SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench. The following table presents the results.

> For SWE-bench Verified, we use OpenHands v0.34.0 with our scaffold strategy. Running limit is set to 100 iterations and history truncation to prevent exceeding context limit, configured with temperature=0.8, top_p=1.0. **We do not use ITERATIVE_EVAL_MODE for evaluation.**
